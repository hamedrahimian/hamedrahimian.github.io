== About me
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/ Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences] at [https://www.northwestern.edu Northwestern University] under supervision of Prof. [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/mehrotra-sanjay.html Sanjay Mehrotra].
I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the [https://ise.osu.edu Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at [https://www.osu.edu The Ohio State University], under supervision of Prof. [http://u.osu.edu/bayraksan.1 Guzin Bayraksan]. 
I also received my M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from [https://www.arizona.edu The University of Arizona] in 2012, 
and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2011 and 2008. 
My Ph.D. research has been recognized by  a *Runner-Up prize in 2017 INFORMS Computing Society Student Paper Award* and a *2nd Place prize in 2019 IISE Pristker Doctoral Dissertation Award*.


== Research
My research focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of decision-making problems in uncertain and risky environments. 
In particular, my research interests include
