== About me
I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/ Department of Industrial Engineering] at [https://www.clemson.edu Clemson University].
Before joining Clemson IE, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/ Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences] at [https://www.northwestern.edu Northwestern University].
I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the [https://ise.osu.edu Department of Integrated Systems Engineering] at [https://www.osu.edu The Ohio State University]. 
I also received my M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from [https://www.arizona.edu The University of Arizona] in 2012, 
and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2011 and 2008. 
My research has been recognized with several awards, including *Runner-Up prize INFORMS Computing Society Student Paper Award* (2017), *2nd Place prize in IISE Pristker Doctoral Dissertation Award* (2019), and the *Harold W. Kuhn Award* (2022).


== Research
My research focuses on data-driven decision-making and learning problems in uncertain and risky environments involving contextual data to develop robust and computationally efficient methodolody with theoretical gunarantees. 
In particular, my research interests include  
 - Stochastic optimization 
 - Data-driven optimization
 - Risk-averse and distributionally robust optimization
